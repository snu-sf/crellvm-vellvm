  symexe_def.v      : Defining symbolic values and states of LLVM IR, and a sub-
                      blocked oriented operational semantics that simplifies the
                      proofs about this TV.

  seop_llvmop.v     : Proved that this special operational semantics is equivalent to
                      the ones defined in vol/src3.0/Vellvm/opsem.v

  symexe_dec.v      : Decidability of equations over symbolic values and states

  symexe_sound.v/symexe_complete.v  : Symbolic states are sound/complete wrt
                                      concrete states

  eq_tv_correct.v  : If the TV returns true, the two programs are indeed equivalent.
