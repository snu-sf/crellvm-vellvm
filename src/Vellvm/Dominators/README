The directory includes source code for the CPP12 submission.

1) cfg.v
   Basic definitions and properties of control-flow-graphs: vertices, arcs,
   successors, reachability and dominance.

2) reach.v 
   Metatheory of reachablity.

3) dom_decl.v 
   Metatheory of dominance.

4) dom_type.v
   The specification of dominance algorithm.

5) dom_set.v
   The Correctness of the AC algorithm.

6) dom_libs.v
   Definitions and properties used by the CHK algorithm.

7) dfs.v
   Depth-first-search.

7) push_iter.v
   The low-level design and metatheory of CHK algorithm.

8) dom_list.v
   The Correctness of the CHK algorithm.

9) dom_tree.v
   Basic definitions and properties of dominator trees constructions. 

10) dom_list_tree.v
   The correctness of CHK-tree algorithm.

11) dom_set_tree.v
   The implementation of AC-tree algorithm. Note: we did not prove the correct
   of AC-tree fully. We implemented the algorithm to compare its performance
   with CHK-tree.

Misc:
1) pull_iter.v
   This is an implementation of Kildall that, at each iteration, pulls
   information from the predeccessors of a node to the node. The Kildall
   algorithm we use push information from a node to its successors at each
   iteration. We implemented pull_iter.v to evaluate some design trade-offs of
   Kildall, do not present pull_iter.v in our paper submission.

2) cpdt_tactics.v
   Tactics copied from Adam Chlipala's book.
